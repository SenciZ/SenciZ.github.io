            <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    As a Graphic Designer and Screen Printer turned Web Developer I enjoy combining my love of visually appealing graphics with my passion for learning to control outputs on the computer screen.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Having worked in the graphic industry for over 15 years I have learned to be an extraordinary team player and at the same time work solely and be responsible for the success or failure of multiple projects at one time. As a business owner, I have acquired skills and knowledge that allow me to understand what it takes to be a great teamplayer and an asset for any organization I work with.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I am not coding or learning new technologies I enjoy anything outdoors. When near water I enjoy racing sailboats or just sailing with frineds for fun otherwise I am rock climbing and hiking or cycling.
